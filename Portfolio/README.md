# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website created to showcase the work and skills of Purushotham Prajapati, a Full-Stack Web Developer. The website features various sections including a hero section, featured projects, skills, and a contact form.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **css/style.css**: Contains the main styles for the portfolio website, defining styles for the body, navigation, sections, buttons, and specific classes like `.projects`, `.hero`, and `.footer`. It also includes styles for light mode and dark mode themes.

- **css/media.css**: Intended for responsive design. This file contains media queries that adjust the styles defined in `style.css` for different screen sizes, ensuring that the layout and elements adapt appropriately on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **index.html**: The main HTML document for the portfolio website. It includes the structure of the webpage, such as the navigation menu, hero section, projects section, skills section, contact form, and footer. It links to the `style.css` and `media.css` files for styling.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the portfolio website.
3. Ensure that the `css` folder is in the same directory as the `index.html` file for proper styling.
